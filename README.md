What challanges did you face installing Android Studio?
The installation process took a significant amount of time, particularly when downloading the SDK and emulator packages, despite having a stable internet connection.

What did you learn about Android App Structure?
I found out that an Android app is made up of a bunch of parts that all work together.
There's the Manifest file that kind of tells the system what the app is about, then there are the Java or Kotlin files where you actually write the code.
The res folder holds stuff like layouts and images, and then there are Gradle files that help build and manage the app. 
It was a bit confusing at first, but seeing how everything is organized made it easier to understand how the app runs.
